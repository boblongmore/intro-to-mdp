## Working with Yangsuite
### installing yangsuite in the Programmability Foundations Lab

Reserve an instance of the [Programmability Foundations Lab](https://www.wwt.com/lab/programmability-foundations-lab)

On the jumphost, install python for windows ([Version 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.8/python-3.8.8-amd64.exe) or lower, python 3.9 is not yet supported)

Use pip to install yangsuite core: `pip install yangsuite[core]`

To start yangsuite, simply type: `yangsuite`

You'll be taken through setup wizard.
Specify a directory, I chose `./yangsuitedata`

Leave the default port of 8480

You can allow remote access, but you don't need to in this lab.
Enter in the superuser credentials and your email address.

Open up a browser on the jumphost and go to <http://localhost:8480>
Accept the EULA and log in using the credentials you previously created.
